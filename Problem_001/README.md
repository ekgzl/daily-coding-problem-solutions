## Problem Statement

> Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

## My Approach

My solution uses two **for loops**. My idea is go through all elements in the array
and check all combinations to make sure the sum of two of them is equal `k`.
